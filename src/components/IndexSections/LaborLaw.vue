		<h2>Labor and Employment Law</h2>
		<p>
			Our Labor & Employment Law Practice covers wage and hour claims, wrongful termination,
			discrimination, and harassment. We have represented a variety of clients in class
			actions as well as individual claims. Our practice is not limited to employees (usually
			as plaintiffs) or employers (usually as defendants). We represent both sides. Having
			represented both sides of the case, we know how to best serve our clients to meet their
			unique needs.
