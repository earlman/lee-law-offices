The law protects you from being discriminated based on race, sex/gender, sexual orientation, age, religion, pregnancy, and disability.  If you have ever experienced any of the following, you are being discriminated: 

* Your promotion was denied after you became pregnant and your supervisor says, “The company needs someone who will be more dedicated to the position.”
* Despite having more experience and qualifications than other applicants, you are passed over for a senior position because of your age, sex, or religious belief.
* Your hours were cut down after you asked for time-off for your medical treatment.
* You recently found out your co-workers earn more than you despite having the same experience and qualifications.
* You are being excluded or isolated by your co-workers. For instance, after your co-workers recently found out you are gay, they started calling you “princess”.
* You are given impossible tasks no matter how hard you try.
* Your supervisor deliberately withholds information you need to do your job.
