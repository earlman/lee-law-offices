Harassment can be verbal or physical.  Your harasser can be your co-worker, supervisor, or even a non-employee like a customer or contractor.  If you have ever experienced any of the following, you are being harassed: 

* “Mexicans are rapists.” 
* “Black people are lazy.” 
* “Why do you keep getting pregnant? Control yourself.”
* “Go back to your country.”
* “Open your slanted eyes.”  
* “You’re too old to get this job done.”
* “I can’t understand your accent.” 
* Your supervisor/co-worker touches your body parts behind you.
* Your supervisor/co-worker constantly stares at your body parts. 
* Your supervisor/co-worker removes or tries to remove your hijab.
