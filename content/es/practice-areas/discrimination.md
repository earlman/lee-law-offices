    <li>
        Your promotion was denied after you became pregnant and your supervisor says, “The company needs someone who will be more dedicated to the position.”
    </li>

        Despite having more experience and qualifications than other applicants, you are passed over for a senior position because of your age, sex, or religious belief.
    </li>
    <li>
        Your hours were cut down after you asked for time-off for your medical treatment.
